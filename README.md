# Spring Boot Scalable Book Library

## About
An attempt to build a scalable Book Library With Postgres. In this app, I learn how to connect to
Lightsail postgres db server so that it is easy to share the data. I also tinker with PostgreSQL
FTS and pg_trgm indexes which can speed up searching operations in a text-heavy application like this one. Will
implement redis cache to cache books' data and use aws S3/cloudfare for book images and some text extraction features
using AWS ML services. Also, auth.
